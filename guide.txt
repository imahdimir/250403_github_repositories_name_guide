Key Words in the name of the repo stands for

These key words should be reserved only for their specific purpose and they shouldn't be used elsewehere

Every repo name starts with its id just in this exact format (iN_) N is the id number wich starts from zero to inifinity. Just a decimal number that increases one by one.
    - For now the last number is kept in another rep, 
    - like: i3_... (so from start to the first _ is the id starts with i to not start it with a number because it might be a python package in python names should start with a letter)

If one repo has one or more associated repos like the data repos that are related to a code repo I name it like this i5_n0_... meaning this is the number zero (first one) and it signals there is another or more repos related to this, the next one would be i5_n1... and i5_n2... and so on.

_SSGAC_tA1_ : (just like this somewhere on the name of the repo usually after the date)
    - tA1: type A1
    - UKB data project, I used ukb data in it and so it is only saved on my UKB folder to keep ukb data private to those who have permission to see the data.
    - CF (code files, files that are completely generated and controlled by the code in the associated code repo) 
        - not necessary small files can be big files no limit because of enough space on NBER servers.
    - Saved on NBER servers only not local due to data privacy &/or file sizes
    - Also it signals it is a SSGAC repo so I don't add SSGAC keyword again after this.
    - Usually contains inp/ med/ out/ subdirs.
    - /Out/ folder contains only data and outputs that can be moved outside the servers. Only Output results that can be public.
    - Just listed the name on the Github public but empty to reserve the name only
    
_SSGAC_tA2_:
    - The outputs that are on the server or produced locally but with the same code repo
    - Contains SSGAC_tA1 full name/out_synced/ folder which is synced with the NBER server by running rsync between the local machine &           server.
    - I also save other locally created files in the folder in this repo (try to produce all the data on the server and just sync results         to avoid more complextity and creating venv on the lcoal machine try find to have all the tools and venv on the server.
    - It will be public repo on Github

_CF_:
    - Code files, the data that are inputed or created by another associated code repo either in med/ or out/

^(start of the name)
^iN_n0_...
    - The code repo that has one or more associated data repo that are named ^iX_n1_CF something like this.
    - ^iX_n1_EmptyOnlyListed for those repos that are empty and only there to reserve the name in the namespace like _SSGAC_tA1 repos.

_SF_:
    - Used for repos that has only small files in it, for archiving in a safe place.
    - Not produced by code but it is manuall like a manuscript or a draft for a paper or some document to archive or to version

^_iN_p1:
    - Used for repos that has parts in other repos to not keep too many files in a single repo like only has 100 files not more.

_SSGAC_:
    - for all repos related to SSGAC

_Alex_:
    - All repos that are related to the work with Alex
