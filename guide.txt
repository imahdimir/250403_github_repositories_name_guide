Key word in the name of the repo stands for
These key words should be reserved only for their specific purpose and 
they shouldn't be used elsewehere

Every repo name starts with its id that kept in another repo (the last one number), like: i3_ (so start to the first _ is the id starts with i to not start it with a number because it might be a python package in python names should start with a letter)
if one repo has one or more associated repos like the data repos that are related to a code repo I name it like this i5i0 meaning this is the number zero (first one) and it signals there is another or more repos related to this, the next one would be i5i1 and i5i2 and so on.

SSGAC_tA1 : (just like this somewhere on the name of the repo usually after the date)
    - tA1 to type A1
    - UKB data project, I used ukb data in it and so it should be save on my UKB folder to keep ukb data private to those who have permission to see the data.
    - CF (code files, files that are completely generated and controlled by the code in the associated code repo) - not necessary small files can be big files no limit because of enough space on NBER servers.
    - Saved on NBER servers only not local due to data privacy &/or file sizes
    - Also it signals it is a SSGAC repo so I don't add SSGAC keyword again after this.
    - Usually contains inp/ med/ out/ subdirs.
    - /Out/ folder contains only data and outputs that can be moved outside the servers
    - just listed the name on the Github public but empty to reserve the name only
    
SSGAC_tA2:
    - The outputs that are on the server or produced locally but with the same code repo
    - Contains SSGAC_tA1 full name/out__synced/ folder which is synced with the NBER server by running a rsync instance between the local machine & server
    - I also save other locally created files in local/ folder in this repo
    - It will be public repo on Github
