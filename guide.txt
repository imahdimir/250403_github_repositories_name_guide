Rule:
^iN_...$ 
Every repo name starts with its id just in this exact format (iN_)
    - Simple & Permenant Rule
    - N is the id number wich starts from zero to inifinity. Just a decimal number that increases one by one.
    - last number is kept in this repo: https://github.com/imahdimir/i0_my_github_repo_id_keeper/blob/main/last_id.txt
    - like: i3_... 
    - So from start to the first _ is id.
    - The id starts with i to not start it with a number because it might be a python package in python names cannot start with a letter.

_SSGAC_tA1_ : (just like this somewhere on the name of the repo usually after the date)
    - tA1: type A1
    - UKB data project, I used ukb data in it and so it is only saved on my UKB folder to keep ukb data private to those who have permission to see the data.
    - CF (code files, files that are completely generated and controlled by the code in the associated code repo) 
    - not necessary small files can be big files no limit because of enough space on NBER servers.
    - Saved on NBER servers only not local due to data privacy &/or file sizes
    - Also it signals it is a SSGAC repo so I don't add SSGAC keyword again after this.
    - Usually contains inp/ med/ out/ subdirs.
    - /Out/ folder contains only data and outputs that can be moved outside the servers. Only Output results that can be public.
    - Just listed the name on the Github public but empty to reserve the name only
    - Private repo on Github
    
_SSGAC_tA2_:
    - The outputs that are on the server or produced locally but with the same code repo
    - Contains associated SSGAC_tA1 full name/out_synced/ folder which is synced with the NBER server by running rsync between the local machine &           server.
    - It will be a private repo on Github

_CF_:
    - Code files, the data that are inputed or created by another associated code repo either in med/ or out/

_SF_:
    - Used for repos that has only small files in it, for archiving in a safe place.
    - Not produced by code but it is manuall like a manuscript or a draft for a paper or some document to archive or to version

^_iN_pX:
    - Used for repos that has parts in other repos to not keep too many files in a single repo like only has 100 files not more.

_SSGAC_:
    - for all repos related to SSGAC

_Alex_:
    - All repos that are related to the work with Alex
